Assalamu Alaikum bhaiya, 

1. Swimming Pool 2. Gate detection.

Task 1 : i talked with some of my friends and they told me they can manage, but still depends on usage, as we are going to use machiene, i have to talk with them thoroughly. I can't make any promise. But i will try.

Task 2: I was told that a video will be given to me to detect the gate. As i didn't get that video i made a gate by myself and tried to make it as noise proof as possible.Please see the video.

Have a good day.
